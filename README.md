# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a Snake game built using **Pygame** and a reinforcement learning agent trained with **PyTorch** to play the game. The goal is to create an agent that learns to play Snake using a combination of **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** and **reward-based reinforcement** mechanisms.

## Features
- **Interactive Snake Game** built using **Pygame**
- **Deep Q-Learning** agent trained using **PyTorch**
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation and improvement
- Logging and performance tracking for training progress
- Configurable environment and hyperparameters for reinforcement learning

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyTorch

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pygame 
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib ipython

```
